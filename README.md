# MMDA222- Timed In-Class Assignment

This repository contains the code for my 2023 MMDA222 In-Class Assignment, completed within a strict 2-hour timeframe. The task was to replicate a webpage, "Mining the Sky," focusing on the potential of mining asteroids for valuable resources.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) is organized with a header, content sections, and informative details about asteroid mining. Key sections include "Formation," detailing the cosmic origin of elements, a table listing the most profitable asteroids, and information on other celestial sources of wealth.

## CSS Styling

Styles are defined in the `styles.css` file, enhancing the visual appeal of the webpage. Notably, the header has a dynamic background image, and various sections are styled for readability. The CSS also incorporates media queries to ensure a responsive layout on different screen sizes.

## Responsive Design

The webpage adapts to different screen sizes using media queries. It ensures optimal viewing on both larger screens and mobile devices, maintaining readability and aesthetics.

### Key Features:
- **Header:** Centered title with a stylish background image.
- **Content:** Sections are styled for clarity, with distinct formatting for tables and blockquotes.
- **Media Queries:** Responsive design for various screen sizes, optimizing user experience.

## Mining Concerns and Future Prospects

The content discusses the potential of asteroid mining, highlighting significant asteroids and other celestial bodies as sources of valuable resources. It mentions companies actively exploring this frontier and the ongoing technological developments in this field.

## Conclusion

This assignment not only explores the technical aspect of HTML and CSS coding under time constraints but also delves into the intriguing possibilities of mining resources from space. The repository serves as a snapshot of my work during the MMDA222 course, capturing both the coding and conceptual aspects of the assignment.
